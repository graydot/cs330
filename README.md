Module Eight Journal Reflection
=============================

# How do I approach designing software?
## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This is the first time I have worked on creating 3D graphics. It has been really fun. The main design skill I have learnt is to map an abstract idea of a scene into graphics code. The first stage is choosing art, then creating a rough idea of the 3d representation, then mapping out possible coordinates and placement, finding art for textures and finally tying them all together. These are parts of the SDLC that is not typical in non 3D graphics programs. 
## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed typical SDLC processes. I first got requirements, then created a design decisions document, began writing code iteratively and testing. I would like to add tests to the project which I haven't done so far.
## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Finding art for scenes and graphics will be useful for me in the future.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approached developing the project iteratively. While the milestones are setup to incrementally advance towards the final project, I iteratively worked within the milestones itself. For example, in the lighting milestone, I first turned on ambient light and then tried adding a single colored light. I had a key processor which used to turn that light on and off so I could debug lighting. This kind of iteration helped me gradually make progress by solving one problem at a time from known good state rather than getting overwhelmed with all problems.

One thing I learnt as I deveeloped these programs is to add debug options to the code. For example in the module 8 assignment where we build a game I added keystroke listeners to pause and resume the game, enable/disable logging and slowing and speeding up the game. This helped me debug pretty complex bugs.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I am interested in robotics so processing images is important for me. Understanding how things are rendered, coordinate space etc will allow me to represent real world objects in computer or robotic memory.
